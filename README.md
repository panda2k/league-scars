# League Scars
## What is League Scars?
League scars is a website that allows players to see how much pain and trauma they've inflicted on others. We've all been stomped by a Shaco and
banned Shaco for the next 10 games. This site allows you to click on a game and see how many players banned your champ for their following games. 
For example, lets say I did extremely well on Akali one game. I can search myself up and click on the game to reveal that after the game, player x, y, and z banned
Akali for 3, 5, and 7 games straight, respectively.


## How does League Scars work?
League Scars is built on Next.js, Typescript, and TailwindCSS. The site uses the [League of Legends API](https://developer.riotgames.com) to fetch match data.
